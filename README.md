I'm a 23-year-old **$\color{#FFD600}{Full-Stack} \space {Application} \space {and} \space {Web} \space {Developer}$** who started learning how to code in **$\color{#FFD600}{2021}$**, my journey started with **$\color{#FFD600}{C++}$** which led me to learn one of the most famouse frameworks which is called $\color{#FFD600}{QT}$, my vision and thirst of learning didn't stop there.
I decided to learn $\color{#FFD600}{Web} \space {Development}$ the decision that helped me to have better understanding of coding.
