I'm a 24-year-old **$\color{#FFD600}\textbf{Full-Stack} \space \textbf{Web} \space \textbf{and} \space \textbf{C++ } \textbf{Developer}$**. As I started learning how to code in **$\color{#FFD600} \textbf{2021}$** by digging into **$\color{#FFD600} 
 \textbf{C++}$** I found my way to the world of programmers. My curiosity didn't stop there and led me to the path of $\color{#FFD600}\textbf{Web Development}$, since I'd already known C++ it wasn't challanging to learn syntax of $\color{#FFD600}\textbf{JS}$, $\color{#FFD600}\textbf{CSS}$ and $\color{#FFD600}\textbf{HTML}$  but took me a while to learn the concepts of it.
Web development helped me to go deeper into programming and gave me the ambition of following my childhood dream, becoming a $\color{#FFD600} \textbf{} \space \textbf{Game Developer}$ in the future.
